~~CREDIT TO THE MAIN MOD THIS IS AN ADD ON TO~~~
ALL MODELS AND ANIMATIONS (unless otherwise specified below) ARE FROM THE SWEM MOD and their team of talented animators, coders, and designers. This mod makes no claim to their models and designs. When they are used explicit credit is given, and they are only used in their original format or in ways to be true to their original formats.

Their work is their own and this mod only uses their models and animations in order to produce more items of their determined classes for resource pack creation or to produce ribbon/trophy variants that are able to be displayed as they wanted them to be displayed but also retain their NBT and named data.
