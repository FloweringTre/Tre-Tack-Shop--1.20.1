# Tre's Tack Library

Frustrated you can't render the whole leg for your SWEM boots?
Does it anger you that you can't have two reins?
Pulling out your hair wanting to add flair to your pony's mane and tail?

## Have no fear, the Tack Library is here!
This small library mod works with its [connected texture pack](https://legacy.curseforge.com/minecraft/texture-packs/tres-tack-library-resources) to call the SWEM Horse model to render more bones for different tack items!

***Current offerings!***
- Render both reins and bits for all three bridle types so pick whatever rein(s) and bits you like!
- Leg Wraps go up the whole leg and also allow you to decorate the mane and forelock
- Turn your bulky Saddle Bag to a place to decorate your pony's tail!
- Render the whole haunch/hip area with the saddle blanket (previously missing the top section).
